Models

The Models folder contains the components responsible for handling data and business logic.
 These components are referred to as "models." Models represent the underlying data structure and encapsulate 
 the logic required to interact with and manipulate that data.

Database Abstraction: In web applications, models often abstract the database schema. 
They define the structure of database tables or collections and provide an interface to perform CRUD
 (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data stored in the database.

Data Validation: Models are responsible for data validation

Interactions with Controllers and Views: Models act as intermediaries between the Controller and the data. 
When a user interacts with the application (through the View)

Separation of Concerns: The use of models in the MVC pattern promotes the separation of concerns.

Reusability: Models can often be reused in different parts of the application.
