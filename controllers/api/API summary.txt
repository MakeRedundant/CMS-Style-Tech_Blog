An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

In the context of web development, an API often refers to a web API,
 which is a collection of endpoints (URLs) and rules for making HTTP requests to access or manipulate data on a server. 


In my code i put the API routes responsible for handling requests inside the API folder

While the routes responsible for rendering web pages or views inside the controllers folder separate 

API Routes (comment-routes.js, post-routes.js, user-routes.js) - Inside "controllers/api":

These routes are typically responsible for handling HTTP requests related to your API endpoints.
They deal with data manipulation, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in your database.
API routes often respond with JSON data or other machine-readable formats,
Routes in this folder might include CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for comments, posts, and users,

Web Routes (homeRoutes.js, dashboardRoutes.js) - Inside "controllers":

These routes are responsible for rendering web pages or views that users interact with directly in their web browsers.
They often involve rendering HTML templates and serving them to the client for display.
